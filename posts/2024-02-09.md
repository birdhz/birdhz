i'm not sure why i wanted to start blogging.

i used to love writing; i guess can be a way to reinvigorate that aspect of myself.
my mind feels like an unnavigatable mess; it's like a dishelved room or closet where at a glance i can find what i'm looking for if i happened to see it or move it recently; otherwise, it's too much to comprehend. so maybe writing in the context of a blog will both help me focus myself and tidy the metaphorical room.
i'm going to try my best not to self-editorialize, at least while i try to get into the habit of writing again. the mistakes are there and that's okay. it's okay to be disorganized.

i am a person in this world; i have self-agency. maybe part of it is wanting to make a difference. maybe it's an attempt to try to place my ethics into some actionable thing.

hopefully over time i can begin to distill my wandering and ephemeral thoughts into something coherent.
