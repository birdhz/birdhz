# birdhz site

i plan to use this repo with github actions to push onto [a neocities website](https://birdhz.neocities.org) for a personal blog / website.

## todo
- [ ] figure out posts and date formats (don't need the extra times & zone codes)
- [ ] add a footer layout
- [ ] use `njk` for layouts
- [ ] add a nav / header layout
- [ ] implement _holy grail layout_
- [ ] work on `not_found` (rename to `404` or figure out how to handle http req errors on 11ty ssg)
- [ ] rss via atom?
- [ ] use semantic tags for templates / layouts
- [ ] what is difference between a template and layout?
