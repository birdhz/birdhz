## ladybug

i guess sometimes when you need it when i need it a ladybug lands near you at work,
reminding you of your deceased aunt who always said she'd return as a ladybug or
a hummingbird, i needed this today, especially after yesterday

it's a nice feeling when someone shares their art with you, when you are amazed
at how much emotion, time, dedication, and effort goes into intricate lines
and shades and colors that meld and flow into each other through a x-foot long
roll of paper that would have otherwise been discarded and forgotten but now
is transformed by an artist

not a _triptych_,  but an _infiniptych_

### blé means wheat in french

Pallets
Make it palatable 
Magazines and sour strings
Candy rings and starry dreams 
Mossy films on cracked concrete
Lichened walls and misplaced meats 
Queasy grins and fabled facts 
Hungry drains and sunlit backs 

Smoke signals

My mind is a puddle
I’m splashing around

### angry walls

These walls are angry
Shouting and screaming
Shrieking I’m shrinking

Maybe I don’t deserve to be heard
And the clock is ticking 

### 02 march 2025

Cigarette
Burnt Armageddon 
Ashen arsenal 
Blank participation 
Latent sadness
Somber demeanor
Too mean for her
Sullen and sunken
Face
Counted annoyances 
Persistent 
Aggressive depression 
Echoes and echoes and echoes
Again and again and again
Walking on raised sidewalk
Beneath fragrant pines
Needles dry and green 
Tumult ocean of rubber and asphalt
It’s my fault 
I fail I relapse I regress
What’a my impression
Is it lacquered blue
Anand stormy reflection
Too much introspection 
Is shallow and waste
What do I have to lose
With leaves underfoot
Underneath the sadness
Hibernates an absolute shame
One I can never name
Does he remember 
How much
It
Hurts
He’s safe in my memories 
Locked away and repressed
He’ll be a prisoner here
While he lives free without remorse
Or even memory
This one in my mind’s catacombs
Dies with me 
Clenching a spent cigarette 
I don’t want to litter
If I let him escape
It will float to the rivers
And though a fish could eat him
And all be forgotten 
I can never forgive 
What lurks in callous whim 
And I’d never forgive myself
If a fish choked on him

### home sick

**Sometimes I don’t want to go home**
**Where my memories haunt**
