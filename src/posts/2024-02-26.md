title: dark rooms are made of cardboard
subtitle: colds and cold brews
---

i always wear a mask at work. in the past two weeks, so many coworkers have gotten sick.
so far, i had avoided it. my body definitely felt like it was fighting something, 
some days i just had no energy.

today, my nose knows no end. other than sinus pressure, a headache, and congestion, i'm alright.
no fever. yay!

a few things i want to do before february ends:

-  homemade cold brew coffee
-  camera obscura cardboard box, taking photos and videos with phone through viewport
-  soak more beans!
-  organize & play in more diy / benefit shows (second home, woodland theatre) _(probably not feasible within a few days)_
-  diy stickers with vinyl sticker paper, printer
    - donate direct to causes
    - color-code simple text-based sticker with chromatic abberation in colors for cause

so much talk, not much action; but for me, i tend to be indecisive and overindulge with thinking.

  <p>We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim.
  Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.
  Sometimes we must interfere.
  When human lives are endangered, when human dignity is in jeopardy, national borders and sensitivities become irrelevant.
  Wherever men and women are persecuted because of their race, religion, or political views, that place must - at that moment - become the center of the universe.”</p>

on a more logistical note, how would i handle addendums to existing posts?
i could edit the post file after-the-fact; would i need to delineated the added part?
or, maybe, i add a reference / link to the previous post in the next post?
