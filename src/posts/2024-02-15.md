title: sometimes i struggle
subtitle: proselytize sadness
---

i'm belligerent toward myself when i'm depressed and unaffected.

my demeanor has been exhausting lately.

at work, i wander between hopeless emptiness and mild generic contentedness.
at home, i roam the halls of my mind, staring at walls, longing for an exit.

in my garden spaces - where i've become more myself with music and friends -
the plants become withered and pale after a stilted rush of vibrance from rain,
i can't be quenced, what even needs respite.

in digital social media, i make short stints of engagement,
only to be quickly followed by my absence and resignation for a bit.

with my closest friends, i don't remember the last time i talked to her;
i abandoned another in need with an excuse;
another couple are incredibly kind and welcoming to me,
but i'm too self-absorbed with my sadness and i stay aloof.

i don't know what to do sometimes.
and that's ok.
i don't know what to do other times.
and it doesn't feel ok.
