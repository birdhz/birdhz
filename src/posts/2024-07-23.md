## a thought

<article class='poem'>
<h3>desensitization and sensitivity</h3>

with desensitization<br>
do we reduce ourselves to blank stares,<br>
blanket apathy,<br>
stairways to nowhere<br>

or

does desensitization<br>
give space<br>
room<br>
breath to an environment<br>
shrouded in noise<br>

</article>

from what i understand,
being <em>desensitized</em> closes oneself to their surroundings,
locking themselves into inner realities crafted from ambivalence.
this indifference arises from sensory overload and overstimulation.
so, is being too sensitive a catalyst for desensitization?

must we "un-sensitize" ourselves to the thundering cacophany of our lives?
can we retain our sensitivity and even cultivate it through practiced un-sensitization?
do we sanitize, curate,
our digestion of sensory stimuli in order to hone our sensitivity into a refined self-awareness?
then, let's ~~capture~~ salvage this mindful sensory awareness into colorful and rich experience,
fully connecting ourselves, inward and outward.

## web ideas

### tags

add front-matter tags to posts to be able to categorize them through 11ty collections.

### pagination

when clicking on the "blog" navlink, the url redirects to `<site>/blog/`.
these listings are currently unpaginated.
that's not too important right now,
but once there are more than a few dozen posts it may be too long of a list to read easily.

related to this, when clicking on any of the posts,
the url becomes `<site>/posts/<filename>/`.
the `posts` component should probably be `blog` for navigation consistency.

### rename post file names

the file names do not convey any meaningful context to the contents of the post.
they should probably use the post's title: `<site>/blog/<title>`.

### sub-sites (for more experimentation)

local sub-site layouts/css/etc would be nice with sandboxing and creative play.
for example, there could be a `tea/` sub-site with completely different layouts and design.
how does that integrate into 11ty?

maybe even a `bitmap/` sub-site that only uses bitmap fonts?

### better use of header tags

which header elements are `title` and `subtitle` front-matters rendered as?
probably use more headers within the markdown files both for organization and improved accessibility.

## inspiration

found a site called `are.na`, looks like a collections aggregation site?
the print site built alongside it creates auto-generated books from a public "channel" (collection),
each page being a "block" (equivalent to a post).

with endless authors and channels,
i think i could discover all sorts of ideas and connections.
