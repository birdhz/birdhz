subtitle: wow i felt like a failure this morning

a second post, i'll try to keep going.

i don't feel myself today; or maybe i feel <em>too much</em> myself.
depression simultaneously is a part of me and not.
can the internal be both internalized and externalized?

i think that i overstimulated my dopamine paths playing a new game called <cite>The Finals</cite> yesterday.
one of the reasons i stopped playing <cite>Apex Legends</cite> was how addictive it was for me
and how much it overemphasized my reward paths to where i felt little when playing it
and when i wasn't, i felt the deficit and compounded with depression it became nightmarish.
paralysis, indecision, apathy, boredom, self-defeatism, uninspiration, hopelessness, emptiness.

<q>curiosity kills the cat, and depression kills the curiosity.</q>

i need to remind myself that it's okay to sit with my perceived failings.

i'm not a goal-oriented person, but i know working on my creative outlets
(like this site) helps me.
like i'm cultivating self-growth and externally i can see reminders of that.
