and i feel this vapid obsession of oblivion
i can't steal a hopeful glance
i can't steal a glance of hopefullness
and my leaden limbs **glare** back at me
with no remorse
and i'm weeping
shedding away shimmering smile
all the blankets are lost;
i've been frozen for all time
and the stench of this longing
for the cessation of despondence
where do i belong
no response
my throat churns
my teeth burn
and this unholy immolation
will scorch the gardens 
i used to tend
everyday
until there's sand
dirt
gravel
and refuse

i refuse
i refuse
i refuse
i refuse
